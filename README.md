# Bitsailor

### Sailing route optimization

Bitsailor uses the well-known Isochrones method for sailing route optimization. This is basically a brute-force algorithm that computes all positions reachable from a given position by moving with constant speed and direction for a fixed amount of time (eg. 10min). The resulting positions are filtered to prevent exponential growth and constitute the next isochrone.

#### Map
Bitsailor uses geodata provided by [FOSSGIS e.V.](https://www.fossgis.de/) which in turn uses OpenStreetMap data.

Map data is accessed with libgdal. The 'Land Polygons' file with split polygons from openstreetmapdata is used. A geospatial index is computed off-line on the set of polygons. (The non-split polygons file, while smaller, provides a less selective index and is therefor much slower).

At runtime the index is used to quickly find and intersect polygons with the boat path. In order to improve performance, a 1Â° tile cache is used . If neither the tile containing the start point nor the tile containing the end point of the path contain any land, the exact land check is skipped.

#### Polars
Boat polars are provided as CSV files or in JSON format containing separate array for each sail. Data is interpolated to 0.1 degrees and 0.1 m/s. The resulting arrays are compressed into a single array returning both the best sail and the corresponding speed.

### Installation

#### Prerequisites


*	Install libgdal with GEOS support via apt (package name may vary)
	
	```bash
	$ sudo apt-get install libgdal20
	```

	or following [these instructions](https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/BuildingOnUnix). 
	In the latter case first install libgeos-3.4.2 (or newer) and dev files
	
	```bash
	$ sudo apt-get install libgeos-3.5.0
	$ sudo apt-get install libgeos-dev
	```
	Then do

	```bash
	$ ./configure --with-geos=yes
	```

	Check that GEOS support is available.

*	Download the Land polygons shapefile, WGS84 projection, split polygons from [osmdata.openstreetmap.de](https://osmdata.openstreetmap.de/data/land-polygons.html)

	```bash
	$ wget https://osmdata.openstreetmap.de/download/land-polygons-split-4326.zip
	```

*	Install package mapserver-bin

	```bash
	$ sudo apt-get install mapserver-bin
	```

*	Unpack the shapefile archive. Generate a geospatial index.

	```bash 
	$ unzip land-polygons-split-4326.zip
	$ cd land-polygons-split-4326.zip
	$ shptree land_polygons.shp
	```

In addition, Bitsailor requires 

*	[PolarCL](https://github.com/mak08/PolarCL)

*	[cl-weather](https://github.com/mak08/cl-weather)

*	[cl-map](https://github.com/mak08/cl-map)

*	[cl-grib2](https://github.com/mak08/cl-grib2)

*	[log2](https://github.com/mak08/log2)
	
and	the [quickloadable](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/) systems

*	cl-utilities

*	cffi

*	local-time

*	babel
