	  	<ul>
		  <li> UI wind differs from wind displayed in waypoint info.
			<p>The router delays the switch to the latest GFS cycle to match the update policy of the game.<br>
			  This is controlled by a backend variable *merge-start* (currently no customizable).<br>
			  The UI alwys displays the selected cycle, or the latest cycle if none is selected.

	  	<ul>
		  <li>Isochrones run past destination
			<p>The route search terminates when a route point is generated that is closer to the destination than a given target distance.
			  Sometimes, especially in routings longer than 2.5days and strong wind conditions, no such point is ever generated.</p>
			<p>Move the target point closer to an isochrone to workaround this issue.</p> 
		  </li>

		  <li>Route does not reach destination
			<p>This may happen when wind conditions are unfavourable and the boat's tacking angle is large, or when there are too many obstructions in the area.</p>
			<p>You can usually work around this by moving the target behind or sideways from your actual destination.</p> 
			<p>Also see "Isochrones run past destination"</p>
		  </li>
		  
		  <li> Routing fails with an error message similar to
			<pre><code> error Unexpected HTTP status 404 Not Found for URL
https://ftpprd.ncep.noaa.gov/data/nccf/com/gfs/prod/gfs.20210509/06/atmos/gfs.t06z.pgrb2.1p00.f072.idx</code></pre>
			<p>This is due to a bug in the forecast availability check. The router attempts to download the new forecast too early, when NOAA did not provide the file yet.</p>
			<p>Occasionally, production of forecasts is delayed or broken at NOAA.</p>
			<p>In both cases, retry later or force the old forecast using manual cycle selection.</p>
